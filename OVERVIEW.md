## 1. What IXX is

IXX is two things in one package:

**A small programming language** that looks like a checklist or a set of plain instructions. It uses real English words for comparisons, visible dash characters to show block structure, and `say` to print. It does not require a main function, curly braces, indentation rules, or semicolons.

**An interactive shell** that wraps everyday system tasks — network info, hardware info, disk info, file operations — in the same readable syntax, hiding the native command ugliness underneath.

Both halves share the same identity: readable, calm, obvious output.

```
say "Hello, {name}"

if age less than 18
- say "Not adult"
else
- say "Adult"
```

```
ixx> ip wifi
Wi-Fi: 192.168.1.42

ixx> cpu
  CPU:     AMD Ryzen 9 5950X
  Cores:   16
  Threads: 32
  Usage:   12%

ixx> folder size downloads
  downloads: 14.2 GB
```

---

## 2. Why it exists

### The problem with existing tools

**PowerShell** is powerful but hostile to anyone who does not live in it. Getting a Wi-Fi IP address looks like this:

```powershell
(Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 -InterfaceAlias 'Wi-Fi').IPAddress
```

Getting folder size looks like this:

```powershell
(Get-ChildItem -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads" -Recurse -Force |
 Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum).Sum / 1GB
```

These are real answers to simple questions. Nobody should need to memorize them.

**CMD** is older, less capable, and even less readable.

**Bash** is better but inconsistent across platforms and still requires substantial learning for common tasks.

**Python** is an excellent language but requires `import`, indentation rules, `if __name__ == "__main__"`, and a dozen ways to print a string. It is a great tool but not the right tool for a ten-line task or a quick command.

**The gap:** There is a large space between "type a command and get an answer" and "write a full script in a real language." That space is where IXX lives.

### The language half

Plenty of people can read a recipe, a checklist, or a set of instructions. IXX tries to make code look exactly like that. The logic of `if age is less than 18, say "Not adult"` is obvious to anyone. The only change IXX makes is writing it on two lines with a dash:

```
if age less than 18
- say "Not adult"
```

That is it. That is the syntax.

### The shell half

IXX is also tired of the fact that asking a computer a simple question requires knowing which tool to reach for (`ipconfig`? `Get-NetIPAddress`? `ip addr`? `ifconfig`?), which syntax that tool uses, and then parsing output that looks like it was written for a log file rather than a person.

The IXX shell answers those questions in a consistent, readable way, regardless of what OS you are on or which native command sits underneath.

## 3. The language

### 3.1 Running a script

```
ixx myscript.ixx
```

Or explicitly:

```
ixx run myscript.ixx
```

Or just check syntax without running:

```
ixx check myscript.ixx
```

Scripts start executing from the first line. No entry point boilerplate.

---

### 3.2 Variables

```
name = "Ixxy"
age = 19
score = 3.14
active = YES
```

Variable names are single words: letters, numbers, underscores, starting with a letter or underscore. Assignment uses `=`. No `let`, no `var`, no type annotations.

---

### 3.3 Types

| Type    | Examples                       | Notes                             |
|---------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Text    | `"Hello"`, `"world"`           | Double quotes. UTF-8.             |
| Number  | `42`, `3.14`, `-10`            | Integer or float. Same type.      |
| Boolean | `YES`, `NO`                    | Case-insensitive.                 |
| List    | `"apple", "banana", "grape"`   | Comma-separated series of values. |

---

### 3.4 String interpolation

Use `{varname}` anywhere inside a string:

```
name = "Ixxy"
say "Hello, {name}"
# → Hello, Ixxy
```

```
score = 92
say "Your score is {score} out of 100"
# → Your score is 92 out of 100
```

If the variable does not exist, `{varname}` is left as literal text without crashing.

---

### 3.5 The dash block system

This is the most distinctive part of IXX. Instead of indentation or curly braces, blocks use leading dashes.

```
no dash   = top-level
-         = one level deep
--        = two levels deep
---       = three levels deep
```

The space after the dash is optional but recommended. The block belongs to the last statement at the level above it.

**Simple block:**

```
if score at least 90
- say "Grade A"
- say "Well done"
```

**Nested block:**

```
if user is "Ixxy"
- say "Hello Ixxy"
- if age at least 18
-- say "Adult account"
-- say "Full access"
- else
-- say "Limited account"
```

This is unambiguous. You can read it at a glance. No counting spaces. No invisible indentation errors.

Under the hood, the preprocessor converts dashes to spaces before the Lark parser sees the source. The user never has to think about this.

---

### 3.6 Comparisons

All comparison operators use words:

| Operator    | Meaning            | Example                        |
|-------------|--------------------|--------------------------------|
| `is`        | equal              | `if score is 100`              |
| `is not`    | not equal          | `if status is not "banned"`    |
| `less than` | strictly less      | `if age less than 18`          |
| `more than` | strictly greater   | `if score more than 50`        |
| `at least`  | greater or equal   | `if score at least 90`         |
| `at most`   | less or equal      | `if lives at most 2`           |
| `contains`  | membership / text  | `if items contains "banana"`   |

`contains` works on both lists and text:

```
fruits = "apple", "banana", "grape"
if fruits contains "banana"
- say "Found it"

message = "Hello World"
if message contains "World"
- say "Found World"
```

---

### 3.7 Logic

```
if ready and logged_in
- say "Go"

if tired or bored
- say "Take a break"

if not active
- say "Account is inactive"
```

`and`, `or`, `not` are the complete set. Parentheses can be used for grouping.

---

### 3.8 Arithmetic

```
total  = score + bonus
diff   = 100 - score
area   = width * height
half   = total / 2
neg    = -score
```

String concatenation uses `+`:

```
greeting = "Hello, " + name
```

---

### 3.9 if / else

```
if condition
- statement
- statement
else
- statement
- statement
```

`else` is optional. There is no `else if` yet — nested `if` inside the `else` block serves the same purpose:

```
if score at least 90
- say "A"
else
- if score at least 80
-- say "B"
- else
-- say "Below B"
```

---

### 3.10 loop

Repeats while a condition is true:

```
count = 3

loop count more than 0
- say "Countdown: {count}"
- count = count - 1

say "Done"
```

This is equivalent to `while` in other languages. There is no `for` loop yet. `loop` is the one loop construct.

---

### 3.11 say

Outputs to the screen. Accepts one or more comma-separated expressions:

```
say "Hello World"
say name
say "Score:", score
say fruits
# → apple, banana, grape
```

Lists are printed as comma-separated values. Numbers and booleans are printed as-is.

---

### 3.12 Comments

```
# This is a comment
say "Hello"   # This also works inline
```

Lines starting with `#` are ignored. Inline comments after code are supported.

---

### 3.13 Truthiness

| Value type | True when      | False when   |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| Boolean    | `YES`          | `NO`         |
| Number     | any non-zero   | `0`          |
| Text       | any non-empty  | `""`         |
| List       | non-empty list | empty list   |

---

### 3.14 Scoping

Variables set inside a block that were already defined in an outer scope are updated in the outer scope. Variables created for the first time inside a block are local to that block.

```
count = 10

if count more than 5
- count = count - 1     # outer count is modified

say count               # → 9
```

---

### 3.15 A complete example

```
name = "Ixxy"
age = 19
score = 92
fruits = "apple", "banana", "grape"

say "Hello, {name}"

if age less than 18
- say "Not adult"
else
- say "Adult"

if score at least 90
- say "Grade: A"

if fruits contains "banana"
- say "Found banana"

count = 3
loop count more than 0
- say "Countdown: {count}"
- count = count - 1

say "Done"
```

Output:

```
Hello, Ixxy
Adult
Grade: A
Found banana
Countdown: 3
Countdown: 2
Countdown: 1
Done
```

---

## 4. The shell

### 4.1 Opening the shell

```
ixx
```

or:

```
ixx shell
```

Both open the IXX interactive prompt:

```
IXX Shell  0.3.0-dev
Type a command to get started, or 'help' for a list.
Type 'exit' to leave.

ixx>
```

---

### 4.2 What works in v0.3.0

These commands run real system queries on Windows:

**Network**

```
ixx> ip
Adapter      IPv4
-----------  ---------------
Wi-Fi        192.168.1.42
Ethernet     not connected

ixx> ip wifi
Wi-Fi: 192.168.1.42

ixx> ip ethernet
No connected Ethernet adapter found.

ixx> ip local
192.168.1.42          Wi-Fi

ixx> network
Adapter   Status       IPv4          Gateway
--------  -----------  ------------  -----------
Wi-Fi     connected    192.168.1.42  192.168.1.1
```

**Hardware**

```
ixx> cpu
  CPU:     AMD Ryzen 9 5950X
  Cores:   16
  Threads: 32
  Usage:   12%

ixx> cpu core-count
  AMD Ryzen 9 5950X
  Cores:   16
  Threads: 32

ixx> ram
  RAM
  Total: 64.0 GB
  Used:  21.0 GB
  Free:  43.0 GB
```

**Disk**

```
ixx> disk
Drive  Label   Total    Free
-----  ------  -------  --------
C:     System  2.0 TB   870.0 GB
D:     Data    4.0 TB   2.1 TB

ixx> disk space

-----  ------  -------  ------  --------  -----
C:     System  2.0 TB   1.1 TB  870.0 GB  57%
```

**Files and folders**

```
ixx> folder size downloads
  downloads: 14.2 GB

ixx> folder size "desktop/my project"
  my project: 841.3 MB

ixx> list downloads
  C:\Users\you\Downloads

  Name              Type    Size
  ----------------  ------  --------
  Projects          folder  -
  report.pdf        file    1.2 MB
  photo.png         file    842 KB

ixx> open desktop
  Opened: C:\Users\you\Desktop
```

---

### 4.3 Single-command mode

Run one shell command and exit — useful for automation and scripts:

```
ixx do "ip"
ixx do "ip wifi"
ixx do "cpu core-count"
ixx do "folder size downloads"
```

Both of these work identically:

```
ixx do "ip wifi"
ixx do ip wifi
```

---

### 4.4 Path aliases

These aliases are understood anywhere a path is accepted:

| Alias       | Resolves to                     |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| `desktop`   | `~/Desktop`                      |
| `downloads` | `~/Downloads`                    |
| `documents` | `~/Documents`                    |
| `pictures`  | `~/Pictures`                     |
| `music`     | `~/Music`                        |
| `videos`    | `~/Videos`                       |
| `home`      | `~` (user home directory)        |
| `temp`      | system temp folder               |
| `appdata`   | `%APPDATA%` on Windows           |
| `here`      | current working directory        |
| `current`   | current working directory        |
| `.`         | current working directory        |

Sub-paths work with forward slashes regardless of OS:

```
ixx> folder size desktop/projects
ixx> list "documents/school stuff"
ixx> open downloads
```

---

### 4.5 Command guidance

If you type a command that has sub-options, the shell shows what you can type next instead of silently failing:

```
ixx> delete

  file      Delete a single file
  folder    Delete a folder [recursive] [force] [dry-run]
  temp      Clean temporary files
  empty-trash  Empty the recycle bin / trash

  Warning: destructive — will prompt before acting.
```

Commands that are "executable parents" — `ip`, `cpu`, `ram`, `disk`, `network` — run an overview and also show their options when you type `?`:

```
ixx> ip ?

  all        All active IPs
  wifi       Wi-Fi IPv4 address
  ethernet   Ethernet IPv4 address
  local      All local/private IPs
  public     Public-facing IP address
```

---

### 4.6 Help system

```
ixx> help

ixx> help ip
ip  -  Show active local IP addresses

  Subcommands:
    all       All active IPs
    wifi      Wi-Fi IPv4 address
    ethernet  Ethernet IPv4 address
    local     All local/private IPs
    public    Public-facing IP address

  Examples:
    ip
    ip wifi
    ip ethernet
    ip local

ixx> help folder
folder  -  Folder operations

  Subcommands:
    size   Size of a folder

  Examples:
    folder size downloads
    folder size desktop
    folder size "desktop/my folder"
```

---

### 4.7 Fuzzy correction

Mistyped commands get a suggestion instead of a hard error:

```
ixx> diks
  Unknown command: diks
  Did you mean: disk?

ixx> foler
  Unknown command: foler
  Did you mean: folder?

ixx> cpoy
  Unknown command: cpoy
  Did you mean: copy?
```

---

### 4.8 Stubs — commands registered but not yet live

Some commands are in the guidance tree but do not execute real operations yet. They print a clean stub message:

```
ixx> gpu
  [gpu  -  not yet implemented, planned for a future release]

ixx> kill process chrome
  [kill process  -  not yet implemented, planned for a future release]

ixx> ssh my-server
  [ssh  -  not yet implemented, planned for remote access release]
```

Registered stub commands: `gpu`, `ports`, `processes`, `kill process`, `copy`, `move`, `delete`, `find file`, `native`, `ssh`, `servers`, `server add`, `server list`, `wifi` (standalone), `cpu temperature`, `cpu speed`, `cpu info`, `ram free`, `ram usage`, `ram speed`, `disk health`, `disk partitions`, `ip public`.

---

## 5. How it works — architecture

### 5.1 The language pipeline

```
your .ixx file
      |
      v
  Preprocessor              ixx/preprocessor.py
  Converts - -- --- lines   
  to standard indentation   
      |
      v
  Lark LALR Parser           ixx/parser.py + ixx/grammar.lark
  Reads the grammar,         
  produces a parse tree      
      |
      v
  AST Transformer            ixx/build_ast.py
  Converts the parse tree    
  to clean data structures   ixx/ast_nodes.py
      |
      v
  Interpreter                ixx/interpreter.py
  Walks the AST and          
  executes your program      
```

**The preprocessor** runs first. It converts dash-based lines into standard 4-space indentation so Lark can handle them with its normal `INDENT`/`DEDENT` mechanism. The user never sees this step.

**The grammar** (`grammar.lark`) is about 70 lines and defines the entire IXX language in LALR form. It is the authoritative language definition.

**The AST transformer** (`build_ast.py`) converts the Lark parse tree into typed Python dataclasses (`ast_nodes.py`): `Program`, `Assign`, `IfStmt`, `LoopStmt`, `SayStmt`, `Compare`, `BinOp`, `ListLit`, and others.

**The interpreter** walks these nodes recursively. It maintains an `Environment` for variable scoping and dispatches each node type to the correct evaluation function.

---

### 5.2 The shell pipeline

```
user types: ip wifi
      |
      v
  Tokenizer                  ixx/shell/repl.py → _tokenize()
  Splits on whitespace,      
  preserves quoted strings   ["ip", "wifi"]
      |
      v
  Guidance Engine            ixx/shell/guidance.py → get_guidance()
  Walks the command tree,    
  returns GuidanceResult:    
  - matched_node             ip.subcommands["wifi"]
  - is_executable            True
  - remaining_args           []
      |
      v
  Handler Dispatch           repl.py main loop
  Calls node.handler()       
      |
      v
  Command Handler            ixx/shell/commands/network.py → handle_ip_wifi()
  Calls platform adapter     
      |
      v
  Platform Adapter           ixx/shell/platform/windows.py → get_wifi_ip()
  Runs PowerShell/stdlib      
  internally, returns data   "192.168.1.42"
      |
      v
  Renderer                   ixx/shell/renderer.py
  Formats and prints         "Wi-Fi: 192.168.1.42"
```

**The command registry** (`registry.py`) holds the entire command grammar as a tree of `CommandNode` dataclasses. Each node carries its name, description, subcommands, argument hints, examples, safety flags, and handler. No hardcoded string matching anywhere in the REPL.

**The guidance engine** (`guidance.py`) takes a list of tokens and walks the tree to determine: what matched, what comes next, whether it is executable, and what the remaining arguments are. A node with `executable_with_children=True` (like `ip`, `cpu`) runs its overview handler AND keeps its subcommands available.

**Platform adapters** (`platform/`) isolate all OS-specific code. `windows.py` contains PowerShell and WMIC queries. `linux.py` and `macos.py` are stubs for future releases. Command handlers never contain OS-specific logic — they call adapter functions and render the result.

**The renderer** (`renderer.py`) handles all output. It enables ANSI escape codes on Windows via `SetConsoleMode`. It gracefully falls back to plain text on terminals that do not support colour.

---

### 5.3 Data-driven design

The most important architectural principle: the shell is data-driven, not code-driven.

When you type `find file "invoice"`, the REPL does not contain an `if tokens[0] == "find"` check. It asks the guidance engine, which walks the registry tree and returns what to do. Adding a new command means registering a `CommandNode`. Nothing else changes.

This means:
- Help, fuzzy correction, and guidance work automatically for every command.
- Stub commands have exactly the same guidance/help/correction as live commands.
- Replacing a stub handler with a real one requires changing exactly one field.

---

## 6. Design philosophy

### Rule 1: The user types the obvious thing

The user should type what they mean. The system figures out the rest.

```
ip wifi                  not:  (Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPv4 -InterfaceAlias 'Wi-Fi').IPAddress
folder size downloads    not:  (Get-ChildItem $HOME\Downloads -Recurse | Measure-Object -Sum Length).Sum
cpu core-count           not:  Get-CimInstance Win32_Processor | Select NumberOfCores,NumberOfLogicalProcessors
```

### Rule 2: Readable output, not raw data dumps

```
Wi-Fi: 192.168.1.42
```

not:

```
InterfaceAlias : Wi-Fi
AddressFamily  : IPv4
IPAddress      : 192.168.1.42
PrefixLength   : 24
Type           : Unicast
PrefixOrigin   : Manual
SuffixOrigin   : Manual
AddressState   : Preferred
ValidLifetime  : Infinite
PreferredLifetime : Infinite
SkipAsSource   : False
PolicyStore    : ActiveStore
```

### Rule 3: Errors explain themselves

Syntax errors in `.ixx` scripts show the source line, a caret, and a human explanation:

```
ixx: syntax error in script.ixx line 5
  if age less than
                 ^
  Expected a value after "less than".
  Example:  if age less than 18
```

Shell errors are equally calm:

```
ixx: path not found
  desktop/does-not-exist

Try:
  open desktop
```

### Rule 4: Nothing surprising

- Commands that can delete, move, or stop things are clearly labelled as destructive.
- Destructive commands show a warning in their guidance before you run them.
- No command silently fails. No command crashes with a raw Python traceback.
- If something is not implemented yet, it says so clearly.

### Rule 5: The hard OS-specific stuff hides underneath

The platform adapter layer (`shell/platform/`) means the IXX user never sees a PowerShell command, a WMIC query, a `ctypes` call, or a `subprocess` invocation. Those details are the implementation. The IXX command is the interface.

### Rule 6: Adding a command is adding data

The command tree in `stubs.py` is a set of `CommandNode` declarations. Every node carries its own metadata. Guidance, help, fuzzy correction, and safety warnings are derived automatically. There is no separate "help writer" or "autocomplete handler" — those systems read the same data the handlers use.

## 8. Current status and versions

### v0.1.0 — Language prototype (stable, tagged)

The IXX language is working. Scripts run. All language features are implemented and tested.

- `say`, variables, string interpolation
- `if` / `else` with dash blocks
- `loop` with dash blocks
- Nested blocks (up to 3 levels deep)
- Lists and `contains`
- Arithmetic and logic
- `YES` / `NO` booleans
- Comments
- Friendly syntax error messages with source line and caret
- 98 tests passing

### v0.2.0 — Shell skeleton (stable, on `v0.2.0-shell-planning`)

The interactive shell architecture is working. The REPL loop is live. All commands are stubs but the guidance engine, help system, and fuzzy correction all work.

- `ixx` and `ixx shell` open the REPL
- Data-driven `CommandNode` + `CommandRegistry`
- `get_guidance()` engine
- Hint display, help system, fuzzy correction
- 18 commands registered as stubs
- 152 tests passing

### v0.3.0-dev — Real commands (in progress, on `v0.3.0-system-commands`)

First real-usefulness release. Shell commands actually do things.

- 14 live command entries with real Windows implementations
- Platform adapter layer (`shell/platform/`)
- Path alias system (`shell/paths.py`)
- Format helpers: `format_bytes()`, `render_table()`
- `executable_with_children` — parent commands run overview AND show subcommands
- `ixx do "command"` single-dispatch mode
- SSH/server command stubs in the guidance tree
- UTF-8 console output on Windows
- **218 tests passing** (98 language + 54 shell + 66 v0.3.0)

### Implementation note

The current runtime is Python with the Lark parser library. Python is the **prototype vehicle** — it is not the identity of IXX. A future release will ship as a standalone binary compiled from Go, Rust, or a similar language. The Python version will remain as the reference implementation but is clearly labelled as prototype v0.

---

## 9. Long-term vision

IXX should eventually be a single command console that covers the useful everyday parts of PowerShell, CMD, Bash, Linux shells, macOS terminal, and SSH administration — all in one consistent syntax.

The goal is not to replace those tools for power users. The goal is to give everyone else a single, calm interface for the tasks they actually do every day.

### Planned command categories

**System info** (partial in v0.3.0)
```
cpu    ram    gpu    disk    disk health
```

**Network** (partial in v0.3.0)
```
ip    ip wifi    network    ports
```

**Processes**
```
processes    kill process chrome
```

**Files** (partial in v0.3.0)
```
list    open    folder size    find file
copy report.pdf to desktop
move old-folder to archive
delete folder temp recursive
```

**Services and system**
```
services    restart service nginx
logs    tail logs nginx
```

**Remote / SSH** (stubs in v0.3.0, implementation planned v0.5.0+)
```
ssh user@192.168.1.50
ssh my-server

run on my-server "disk space"
run on my-server "cpu"

copy report.pdf to my-server:/home/user/
copy my-server:/var/log/syslog to downloads

servers
server add my-server
```

Remote commands use the same IXX syntax as local ones. The prompt makes the target obvious:

```
ixx>                   local
ixx my-server>         connected remote shell
```

### Staged roadmap

| Version | Theme                        | Key additions                                              |
|---------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| v0.1.0  | Language prototype           | IXX language, syntax, interpreter, 98 tests               |
| v0.2.0  | Shell skeleton               | REPL, guidance, fuzzy correction, stub commands            |
| v0.3.0  | First real commands          | ip, cpu, ram, disk, folder, open, list — Windows real      |
| v0.4.0  | Files and processes          | copy/move with safety, find file, ports, processes, native |
| v0.5.0  | Remote access                | SSH profiles, run on server, saved targets                 |
| v0.6.0+ | Services, packages, scripting| systemctl/services, logs, docker helpers, repair tools     |

### The standalone binary

The Python prototype will eventually be replaced by a compiled binary. Likely candidates: **Go** (fastest to ship, good cross-platform), **Rust** (best long-term quality and performance). The binary ships as a single file with no dependencies.

The goal is `ixx` works out of the box on any machine, with no Python, no Lark, no pip install required.

---

## 10. What IXX is not

- **Not trying to replace every advanced use case.** For now, if you need complex libraries, algorithms, or production-scale software, Python, Go, or Rust are still the right tools. IXX's first goal is simple scripts and everyday system control.

- **Not trying to copy every PowerShell feature.** IXX aims to replace the annoying everyday layer first. Deep platform-specific administration can still use native tools when needed, but IXX should eventually cover the common useful workflows cleanly.

- **Not a Bash replacement for DevOps.** IXX does not aim to replace pipeline-heavy shell scripting or CI automation.

- **Not a configuration language.** IXX is an imperative language for logic and commands, not a declarative config format.

- **Not trying to have the most features.** The design constraint is to stay readable. If a feature makes the language harder to read at a glance, it does not belong.

- **Not trying to be clever.** No magic inference, no implicit type coercion weirdness, no surprising operator overloading. IXX does what it says.

---

## The one-sentence version

IXX is a language that feels like executable notes — readable, obvious, and actually usable for real things without needing to be a programmer.
